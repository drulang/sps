App Stuff
==============

SPS is about getting people who love microbrews together.  It is meant to be a live social media app, with a high emphasis on people physically being together

The main concept in SPS are *sessions*. A session is a one time gathering of people to drink a set of random beers in a flight manner.  A leader will create a session in advance, decide on the beers that will be tasted, the location, theme, and set a date.  When the day comes, people will get together at said location and proceed to drink beers, socialize and have fun.

In a sense the app is merely a tool for managing the social gathering.

The app will also be geared towards establishments that cater to microbrews(i.e brewpubs, restaurants like carolina ale house, etc.).  An establishment can hold their own public session in which people come to drink beer, and engage with people through the app.
